Building GHDL from sources for Windows:
***************************************

Note: this was tested with Windows XP SP2 familly edition.

Note: If you want to create the installer, GHDL should be built on a
FAT partition.  NSIS rounds files date to be FAT compliant (seconds are always
even) and because GHDL stores dates, the files date must not be modified.

Required:
* the Ada95 GNAT compiler (GNAT GPL 2005 is known to work).
* NSIS to create the installer.

Unzip,
edit winbuild to use correct path for makensis,
run winbuild.

The installer is in the windows directory.
