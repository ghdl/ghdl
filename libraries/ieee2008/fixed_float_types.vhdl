--   Title      :  Fixed Point and Floating Point types package
--
--   Library   :  This package shall be compiled into a library

--   Purpose   :  Definitions for use in fixed point and floating point
--                arithmetic packages
--
--   Note      :  This package may be modified to include additional data
--             :  required by tools, but it must in no way change the
--             :  external interfaces or simulation behavior of the
--             :  description. It is permissible to add comments and/or
--             :  attributes to the package declarations, but not to change
--             :  or delete any original lines of the package declaration.
