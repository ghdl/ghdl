- The GHDL front-end, package :samp:`std.textio` and the runtime library, :samp:`grt`, are given under :ref:`LIC:GPLv2`.
- The documentation is given under :ref:`LIC:CC-BY-SA`.

.. WARNING::
	As a consequence of the runtime copyright, you are not allowed to distribute an executable produced by GHDL without the VHDL sources. To my mind, this is not a real restriction, since it is pointless to distribute VHDL executable. Please, send a comment (:ref:`requesting_enhancements`) if you don't like this policy.

	- These from library :samp:`ieee` are copyrighted by `Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) <https://www.ieee.org>`_ :
