Building GHDL from sources:
***************************

See BUILD.txt

Please report bugs and issues on https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl/issues

If you cannot compile, please report the gcc version, GNAT version and gcc
source version.

* Note for ppc64 (and AIX ?) platform:
The object file format contains an identifier for the source language. Because
gcc doesn't know about the VHDL, gcc crashes very early. This could be fixed
with a very simple change in gcc/config/rs6000/rs6000.c,
function rs6000_output_function_epilogue (as of gcc 4.8):
       else if (! strcmp (language_string, "GNU Objective-C"))
        i = 14;
       else
-       gcc_unreachable ();
+       i = 0;
       fprintf (file, "%d,", i);

       /* 8 single bit fields: global linkage (not set for C extern linkage,
