.. _INTRO:VHDL:

What is `VHDL`?
===============

:wikipedia:`VHDL <VHDL>` is an acronym for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (:wikipedia:`VHSIC <VHSIC>`) Hardware
Description Language (:wikipedia:`HDL <HDL>`), which is a programming language used to describe a logic circuit by
function, data flow behavior, or structure.

Although VHDL was not designed for writing general purpose programs, VHDL *is* a programming language, and you can write
any algorithm with it.
If you are able to write programs, you will find in VHDL features similar to those found in procedural languages such as
`C`, `Python`, or `Ada`.
Indeed, VHDL derives most of its syntax and semantics from Ada. Knowing `Ada` is an advantage for learning VHDL (it is
an advantage in general as well).

However, VHDL was not designed as a general purpose language but as an `HDL`.
As the name implies, VHDL aims at modeling or documenting electronics systems.
Due to the nature of hardware components which are always running, VHDL is a highly concurrent language, built upon an
event-based timing model.

Like a program written in any other language, a VHDL program can be executed.
Since VHDL is used to model designs, the term :dfn:`simulation` is often used instead of `execution`, with the same
meaning.
At the same time, like a design written in another `HDL`, a set of VHDL sources can be transformed with a
:dfn:`synthesis tool` into a netlist, that is, a detailed gate-level implementation.

The development of VHDL started in 1983 and the standard is named `IEEE <https://www.ieee.org/>`__ `1076`.
Five revisions exist:
`1987 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/26487/>`__,
`1993 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/392561/>`__,
`2002 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1003477/>`__,
`2008 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/>`__ and
`2019 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8938196>`__.
The standardization is handled by the VHDL Analysis and Standardization Group (`VASG/P1076 <http://www.eda-twiki.org/vasg/>`__).

.. _INTRO:GHDL:

What is GHDL?
=============

`GHDL` is a shorthand for `G Hardware Design Language` (currently, `G` has no meaning).
It is a VHDL analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental) synthesizer that can process (nearly) any VHDL design.

.. NOTE::
  For almost 20 years, GHDL was *not* a synthesis tool: you could not create a netlist.
  Hence, most of the content in this documentation corresponds to the usage of GHDL as a compiler/simulator.
  See :ref:`USING:Synthesis` for further details regarding synthesis.

Unlike some other simulators, GHDL is a compiler: it directly translates a VHDL file to machine code, without using an
intermediary language such as `C` or `C++`.
Therefore, the compiled code should be faster and the analysis time should be shorter than with a compiler using an
intermediary language.

GHDL can use multiple back-ends, i.e. code generators, (`GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`__, `LLVM <http://llvm.org/>`__ or
:wikipedia:`x86 <X86-64>`/:wikipedia:`i386 <Intel_80386>` only, a built-in one named *mcode*) and runs on
:wikipedia:`GNU/Linux <Linux_distribution>`, :wikipedia:`Windows <Microsoft_Windows>` |trade| and
:wikipedia:`macOS <MacOS>` |trade|; on x86, x86_64, armv6/armv7/aarch32/aarch64, ppc64, etc.

The current version of GHDL does not contain any built-in graphical viewer: you cannot see signal waves.
You can still check the behavior of your design with a test bench.
Moreover, :ref:`GHW`, :wikipedia:`VCD <Value_change_dump>` or `FST` files can be produced, which can be viewed with a
:wikipedia:`waveform viewer <Waveform_viewer>`,
such as `GtkWave <http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/>`__.

GHDL aims at implementing VHDL as defined by `IEEE 1076 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/>`__.
It supports the
`1987 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/26487/>`__,
`1993 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/392561/>`__ and
`2002 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1003477/>`__ revisions and, partially,
`2008 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/>`__.
:wikipedia:`Property Specification Language (PSL) <Property_Specification_Language>` is also partially supported.

Several third party projects are supported:
`Yosys <https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys>`__
(through the `ghdl-yosys-plugin <https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin>`__)
`cocotb <https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb>`__
(through the `VPI interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog_Procedural_Interface>`__),
`VUnit <https://vunit.github.io/>`__, `OSVVM <http://osvvm.org/>`__, ...
