The packages :samp:`std_logic_arith`,

directory is copyrighted by Mentor Graphics.  The source files may be

As a consequence of the runtime copyright, you may not be allowed to
distribute an executable produced by `GHDL` without the VHDL
sources.  To my mind, this is not a real restriction, since there is no
points in distributing VHDL executable.  Please, send a comment
(:ref:`Reporting_bugs`) if you don't like this policy.
