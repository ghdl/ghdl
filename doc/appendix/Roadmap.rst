Roadmap | Future Improvements
#############################

I have several axes for `GHDL` improvements:

* Documentation.
* Better diagnostics messages (warning and error).
* Full support of VHDL-2008.
* Optimization (simulation speed).
* Graphical tools (to see waves and to debug)
* Style checks
* VITAL acceleration
