Roadmap | Future improvements
############

I have several axes for `GHDL` improvements:

* Documentation.
* Better diagnostics messages (warning and error).
* Full support of VHDL-2008.
* Optimization (simulation speed).
* Graphical tools (to see waves and to debug)
* Style checks
* VITAL acceleration

.. TODO::

	- Convert VendorPrimitives Markdown to RST
	- SVG images are not shown in the PDF. That's because LaTeX is used. Can any package be added to allow so?
