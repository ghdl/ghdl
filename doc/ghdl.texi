This manual is the user and reference manual for GHDL. It does not contain an
introduction to VHDL. Thus, the reader should have at least a basic knowledge
of VHDL. A good knowledge of VHDL language reference manual (usually called

@section What is @cite{VHDL}?


VHDL@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL} is an acronym for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHSIC}) Hardware Description Language (HDL@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDL}), which is a programming language used to describe a logic circuit by function, data flow behavior, or structure.

Although VHDL was not designed for writing general purpose programs, VHDL @emph{is} a programming language, and you can write any algorithm with it. If you are able to write programs, you will find in VHDL features similar to those found in procedural languages such as @cite{C}, @cite{Python}, or @cite{Ada}. Indeed, VHDL derives most of its syntax and semantics from Ada. Knowing @cite{Ada} is an advantage for learning VHDL (it is an advantage in general as well).

However, VHDL was not designed as a general purpose language but as an @cite{HDL}. As the name implies, VHDL aims at modeling or documenting electronics systems. Due to the nature of hardware components which are always running, VHDL is a highly concurrent language, built upon an event-based timing model.

Like a program written in any other language, a VHDL program can be executed. Since VHDL is used to model designs, the term @emph{simulation} is often used instead of @cite{execution}, with the same meaning. At the same time, like a design written in another @cite{HDL}, a set of VHDL sources can be transformed with a @emph{synthesis tool} into a netlist, that is, a detailed gate-level implementation.

The development of VHDL started in 1983 and the standard is named IEEE@footnote{https://www.ieee.org/} @cite{1076}. Four revisions exist: 1987@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/26487/}, 1993@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/392561/}, 2002@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1003477/} and 2008@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/}. The standardization is handled by the VHDL Analysis and Standardization Group (VASG/P1076@footnote{http://www.eda-twiki.org/vasg/}).

@section What is GHDL?


@cite{GHDL} is a shorthand for @cite{G Hardware Design Language} (currently, @cite{G} has no meaning). It is a VHDL compiler that can execute (nearly) any VHDL program. GHDL is @emph{not} a synthesis tool: you cannot create a netlist with GHDL (yet).

Unlike some other simulators, GHDL is a compiler: it directly translates a VHDL file to machine code, without using an intermediary language such as @cite{C} or @cite{C++}. Therefore, the compiled code should be faster and the analysis time should be shorter than with a compiler using an intermediary language.

GHDL can use multiple back-ends, i.e. code generators, (GCC@footnote{http://gcc.gnu.org/}, LLVM@footnote{http://llvm.org/} or x86@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64}/i386@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386} only, a built-in one) and runs on GNU/Linux@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution}, Windows@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows} ™  and macOS@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS} ™ , both on x86 and on x86_64.

The current version of GHDL does not contain any graphical viewer: you cannot see signal waves. You can still check the behavior of your design with a test bench. Moreover, the current version can produce a GHW@footnote{http://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/Simulation.html?highlight=GHW#cmdoption-wave}, VCD@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump} or @cite{FST} files which can be viewed with a waveform viewer@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform_viewer}, such as GtkWave@footnote{http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/}.

GHDL aims at implementing VHDL as defined by IEEE 1076@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/}. It supports the 1987@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/26487/}, 1993@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/392561/} and 2002@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1003477/} revisions and, partially, the latest, 2008@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/}. PSL@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_Specification_Language} is also partially supported.

Several third party projects are supported: VUnit@footnote{https://vunit.github.io/}, OSVVM@footnote{http://osvvm.org/}, cocotb@footnote{https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb} (through the VPI interface@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog_Procedural_Interface}), …

@chapter Contributing


The first step might be to use GHDL and explore it’s possibilities in an own project. If you are new to VHDL, see the
@ref{d,,Quick Start Guide} for an introduction. Furthermore, we encourage you to read @ref{e,,Invoking GHDL}, where the most
commonly used options are explained. You can also check the complete @ref{f,,Command Reference}.

If you are more familiar with GHDL, you might start asking yourself how it works internally. Then, you might find
@ref{10,,Implementation of VHDL} and @ref{11,,Implementation of VITAL} interesting.

While using GHDL, you might find flaws, such as bugs, missing features, typos in the documentation or topics which are
still not covered. In order to improve GHDL, we welcome bug reports, suggestions and contributions for any aspect of
GHDL. Either if it’s a bug or an enhancement, have a look at the  and  to see
if someone already told us about it. You might find a solution there.

If you found no information on your topic, please, report so that we are aware! You can reach us through various ways:

@section Reporting bugs


@cartouche
@quotation Tip 

@itemize *

@item 
If the compiler crashes, this is a bug. Reliable tools never crash.

@item 
If the compiler emits an error message for a perfectly valid input or does not emit an error message for an invalid input, this may be a bug.

@item 
If the executable created from your VHDL sources crashes, this may be a bug at runtime or the code itself may be wrong. However, since VHDL has a notion of pointers, an erroneous VHDL program (using invalid pointers for example) may crash.

@item 
If a compiler message is not clear enough, please tell us. The error messages can be improved, but we have not enough experience with them.
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Please, report issues of this kind through , as this allows us to categorize issues into groups and
assign developers to them. You can track the issue’s state and see how it’s getting solved.

@cartouche
@quotation Important 
To make it easier, please elaborate a @cite{Minimum (non) Working Example} (MWE@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example}) prior to sending the report, so that the possible bug source is isolated. Shall the MWE compile and run, it is a good idea to make it look like a test and make an assert statement should finish the execution; the severity level @cite{note} indicates success, while a severity level @cite{failure} indicates failure.

Then, please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the problem. This includes:


@itemize *

@item 
Operating system and version of GHDL (you can get it with @code{ghdl --version}).

@item 
Whether you have built GHDL from sources (provide short SHA of the used commit) or used the binary distribution (tell which release/tag).


@itemize *

@item 
If you cannot compile, please report which compiler you are using and the version.
@end itemize

@item 
Content of the input files which make the MWE

@item 
Description of the problem:


@itemize *

@item 
Comment explaining whether the MWE should compile or not; if yes, whether or not is should run until the assertion.

@item 
What you expected to happen and what you actually get. If you know the LRM well enough, please specify the paragraph which might be not well implemented.

@item 
Samples of any log.

@item 
Anything else that you think would be helpful.
@end itemize
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
If you don’t know the LRM, be aware that an issue claimed as bug report may be rejected because there is no bug according to it. GHDL aims at implementing VHDL as defined in IEEE 1076@footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4772740/}. However, some other tools allow constructs which do not fully follow the standard revisions. Therefore, comparisons with other VHDL is not a solid argument. Some of them are supported by GHDL (see @ref{14,,IEEE library pitfalls}), but any such enhancement will have very low priority.

Contributing source code/documentation via Git@footnote{https://git-scm.com/} is very easy. Although we don’t provide direct
write access to our repositories, the project is hosted at GitHub, which follows a fork, edit and pull-request
flow@footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/} . That is:


@enumerate 

@item 
Make a copy (fork@footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/}) of the project.

@item 
Do the changes you wish (edit, add, rename, move and/or delete).

@item 
When you think that the changes are ready to be merged, you notify the maintainers by opening a Pull Request@footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/} (PR).

@item 
The maintainers will review the proposed changes and will reply in the corresponding thread if any further modification is required. If so, you can keep adding commits to the same branch, and the PR will be automatically updated.

@item 
Last, the maintainers will merge your branch. You will be notified, the PR will be closed, and you’ll be allowed to delete the branch, if you want.
@end enumerate

@cartouche
@quotation Tip 

@itemize *

@item 
It is recommended to read A successful Git branching model@footnote{http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/} for a reference on how maintainers expect to handle multiple branches. However, our actual model is not as exhaustive as explained there.

@item 
Some commit messages can automatically close@footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/} issues. This is a very useful feature, which you are not required to use. However beware that using @cite{fix} anywhere in the commit message can have side effects. If you closed any issue unexpectedly, just reply to it (even if it’s closed) so that maintainers can check it.

It is recommended to read @ref{1b,,Coding Style} before contributing modifications to Ada sources.

@section The @cite{‘Hello world’} program


To illustrate the large purpose of @cite{VHDL}, here is a commented @cite{‘Hello world’} program which saved in a file named @code{hello.vhdl}:

@example
--  Hello world program.
use std.textio.all; -- Imports the standard textio package.

--  Defines a design entity, without any ports.
entity hello_world is
end hello_world;

architecture behaviour of hello_world is
begin
   process
      variable l : line;
   begin
      write (l, String'("Hello world!"));
      writeline (output, l);
      wait;
   end process;
end behaviour;
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Tip 

@itemize *

@item 
Both @code{.vhdl} and @code{.vhd} extensions are used for VHDL source files, while @code{.v} is used for Verilog.

@item 
Unless you use especial characters, either @cite{UTF-8} or @cite{ISO-8859-1} encodings can be used. However, if you do, the latter should be used. The standard defines ASCII (7-bit encoding) or ISO Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) as default. However, GHDL has a relaxing option, @ref{29,,--mb-comments} (multi byte), to allow UTF-8 or other encodings in comments.
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@itemize -

@item 
First, you have to compile the file; this is called @cite{analysis} of a design file in @cite{VHDL} terms. Run @code{ghdl -a hello.vhdl} in the @cite{shell}. This command creates or updates a file @code{work-obj93.cf}, which describes the library @code{work}.

@item 
Then, run @code{ghdl -e hello_world} in the @cite{shell}. Option @ref{2a,,-e} means @emph{elaborate}, which is used to build a design, with the @code{hello_world} entity at the top of the hierarchy.

@item 
Last, you can directly launch the simulation running @code{ghdl -r hello_world} in the @cite{shell}. The result of the simulation will be shown on screen:
@end itemize

@example
Hello world!
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
If a GCC/LLVM variant of @cite{GHDL} is used:


@itemize *

@item 
@cite{Analysis} generates a file, @code{hello.o}, which is the object file corresponding to your @cite{VHDL} program.  This is not created with mcode.

@item 
The elaboration step is compulsory after the analysis and prior to launching the simulation; This wil generate an executable binary named @code{hello_world}.

@item 
As a result, @ref{2b,,-r} is just a passthrough to the binary generated in the @cite{elaboration}. Therefore, the executable can be run directly, @code{./hello_world}. See @ref{2b,,-r} for more informartion.
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
@ref{2a,,-e} can be bypassed with mcode, since @ref{2b,,-r} actually elaborates the design and saves it on memory before running the simulation. But you can still use it to check for some elaboration problems.

@section A full adder


VHDL is generally used for hardware design.  This example starts with a full adder@footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Full_adder} described in a file named @code{adder.vhdl}:

@example
entity adder is
  -- `i0`, `i1` and the carry-in `ci` are inputs of the adder.
  -- `s` is the sum output, `co` is the carry-out.
  port (i0, i1 : in bit; ci : in bit; s : out bit; co : out bit);
end adder;

architecture rtl of adder is
begin
   --  This full-adder architecture contains two concurrent assignment.
   --  Compute the sum.
   s <= i0 xor i1 xor ci;
   --  Compute the carry.
   co <= (i0 and i1) or (i0 and ci) or (i1 and ci);
end rtl;
@end example

You can analyze this design file, @code{ghdl -a adder.vhdl}, and try to execute the @cite{adder} design. But this is useless, since nothing externally visible will happen. In order to check this full adder, a @emph{testbench} has to be run. This testbench is very simple, since the adder is also simple: it checks exhaustively all inputs.  Note that only the behaviour is tested, timing constraints are not checked. A file named @code{adder_tb.vhdl} contains the testbench for the adder:

@example
--  A testbench has no ports.
entity adder_tb is
end adder_tb;

architecture behav of adder_tb is
   --  Declaration of the component that will be instantiated.
   component adder
     port (i0, i1 : in bit; ci : in bit; s : out bit; co : out bit);
   end component;

   --  Specifies which entity is bound with the component.
   for adder_0: adder use entity work.adder;
   signal i0, i1, ci, s, co : bit;
begin
   --  Component instantiation.
   adder_0: adder port map (i0 => i0, i1 => i1, ci => ci,
                            s => s, co => co);

   --  This process does the real job.
   process
      type pattern_type is record
         --  The inputs of the adder.
         i0, i1, ci : bit;
         --  The expected outputs of the adder.
         s, co : bit;
      end record;
      --  The patterns to apply.
      type pattern_array is array (natural range <>) of pattern_type;
      constant patterns : pattern_array :=
        (('0', '0', '0', '0', '0'),
         ('0', '0', '1', '1', '0'),
         ('0', '1', '0', '1', '0'),
         ('0', '1', '1', '0', '1'),
         ('1', '0', '0', '1', '0'),
         ('1', '0', '1', '0', '1'),
         ('1', '1', '0', '0', '1'),
         ('1', '1', '1', '1', '1'));
   begin
      --  Check each pattern.
      for i in patterns'range loop
         --  Set the inputs.
         i0 <= patterns(i).i0;
         i1 <= patterns(i).i1;
         ci <= patterns(i).ci;
         --  Wait for the results.
         wait for 1 ns;
         --  Check the outputs.
         assert s = patterns(i).s
            report "bad sum value" severity error;
         assert co = patterns(i).co
            report "bad carry out value" severity error;
      end loop;
      assert false report "end of test" severity note;
      --  Wait forever; this will finish the simulation.
      wait;
   end process;
end behav;
@end example

As usual, you should analyze the design, @code{ghdl -a adder_tb.vhdl}.

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
Then, if required, elaborate the testbench: @code{ghdl -e adder_tb}. You do not need to specify which object files are required, since GHDL knows them and automatically adds them.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Now, it is time to run the testbench, @code{ghdl -r adder_tb}, and check the result on screen:

@example
adder_tb.vhdl:52:7:(assertion note): end of test
@end example

If your design is rather complex, you’d like to inspect signals. Signal values can be dumped using multiple formats (see section ‘@ref{2e,,Export waveforms}’ for more information). The resulting file can be read with a wave viewer such as GtkWave@footnote{http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/}.

As explained in the manual@footnote{http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave.pdf}, GtkWave @emph{‘relies on a post-mortem approach through the use of dumpfiles’}. Therefore, you should first simulate your design and dump a waveform file, say VCD: @code{ghdl -r adder_tb --vcd=adder.vcd}. Then, you can view the dump: @code{gtkwave adder.vcd}.

See section ‘@ref{2f,,Simulation options}’, for more details on other runtime options.

@section Starting with a design


Unless you are only studying VHDL, you will work with larger designs than the ones of the previous examples. Let’s see how to analyze and run a bigger design, such as the DLX model suite written by Peter Ashenden which is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. A copy is kept on ghdl.free.fr/dlx.tar.gz@footnote{http://ghdl.free.fr/dlx.tar.gz} .


@itemize -

@item 
First, untar the sources: @code{tar zxvf dlx.tar.gz}.
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
In order not to pollute the sources with the library, it is a good idea to create a @code{work/} subdirectory for the @cite{WORK} library.  To any GHDL commands, we will add the @code{--workdir=work} option, so that all files generated by the compiler (except the executable) will be placed in this directory.

@example
$ cd dlx
$ mkdir work
@end example
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@itemize *

@item 
Then, we will run the @code{dlx_test_behaviour} design.  We need to analyze all the design units for the design hierarchy, in the correct order. GHDL provides an easy way to do this, by importing the sources, @code{ghdl -i --workdir=work *.vhdl}.

@item 
GHDL knows all the design units of the DLX, but no one have been analyzed. Run the make option, @code{ghdl -m --workdir=work dlx_test_behaviour}, which analyzes and elaborates a design. This creates many files in the @code{work/} directory, and (GCC/LLVM only) the @code{dlx_test_behaviour} executable in the current directory.
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
The simulation needs to have a DLX program contained in the file @code{dlx.out}. This memory image will be loaded in the DLX memory. Just take one sample: @code{cp test_loop.out dlx.out}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@itemize *

@item 
Now, you can run the test suite: @code{ghdl -r --workdir=work dlx_test_behaviour}. The test bench monitors the bus and displays each instruction executed. It finishes with an assertion of severity level note:

@example
dlx-behaviour.vhdl:395:11:(assertion note): TRAP instruction
 encountered, execution halted
@end example

@item 
Last, since the clock is still running, you have to manually stop the program with the @code{C-c} key sequence.  This behavior prevents you from running the test bench in batch mode. However, you may force the simulator to stop when an assertion above or equal a certain severity level occurs. To do so, call run with this option instead: @code{ghdl -r --workdir=work dlx_test_behaviour --assert-level=note`}. With this option, the program stops just after the previous message:

@example
dlx-behaviour.vhdl:395:11:(assertion note): TRAP instruction
 encountered, execution halted
error: assertion failed
@end example
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Tip 
If you want to make room on your hard drive, you can either:


@itemize *

@item 
Clean the design library with the GHDL command @code{ghdl --clean --workdir=work}. This removes the executable and all the object files. If you want to rebuild the design at this point, just do the make command as shown above.

@item 
Remove the design library with the GHDL command @code{ghdl --remove --workdir=work}. This removes the executable, all the object files and the library file. If you want to rebuild the design, you have to import the sources again, and to make the design.

@item 
Remove the @code{work/} directory: @code{rm -rf work}. Only the executable is kept. If you want to rebuild the design, create the @code{work/} directory, import the sources, and make the design.
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Sometimes, a design does not fully follow the VHDL standards. For example it uses the badly engineered @code{std_logic_unsigned} package. GHDL supports this VHDL dialect through some options: @code{--ieee=synopsys -fexplicit}. See section ‘@ref{14,,IEEE library pitfalls}’, for more details.

The form of the @code{ghdl} command is @code{ghdl command [options...]}. There are multiple available commands, but these general rules apply:


@itemize *

@item 
The first argument selects the command. The options are used to slightly modify the action.

@item 
No option is allowed before the command. Except for the run command, no option is allowed after a filename or a unit name.
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
If the number of options is large and the command line length is beyond the system limit, you can use a response file. An argument that starts with a @code{@@} is considered as a response file; it is replaced by arguments read from the file (separated by blanks and end of line).

@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-a}@anchor{37}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}a <[options...] file...>
@end deffn

Analyzes/compiles one or more files, and creates an object file for each source file. Any argument starting with a dash is an option, the others are filenames. No options are allowed after a filename argument. GHDL analyzes each filename in the given order, and stops the analysis in case of error (remaining files are not analyzed).

See GHDL_options, for details on the GHDL options. For example, to produce debugging information such as line numbers, use: @code{ghdl -a -g my_design.vhdl}.

@geindex cmd elaboration

@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-e}@anchor{2a}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}e <[options...] primary_unit [secondary_unit]>
@end deffn

Re-analyzes all the configurations, entities, architectures and package declarations, and creates the default configurations and the default binding indications according to the LRM rules. It also generates the list of objects files required for the executable. Then, it links all these files with the runtime library. The actual elaboration is performed at runtime.


@itemize *

@item 
The elaboration command, @ref{2a,,-e}, must be followed by a name of either:

@quotation


@itemize *

@item 
a configuration unit

@item 
an entity unit

@item 
an entity unit followed by a name of an architecture unit
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end itemize

Name of the units must be a simple name, without any dot.  You can select the name of the @cite{WORK} library with the @code{--work=NAME} option, as described in GHDL_options. See section ‘@ref{39,,Top entity}’, for the restrictions on the root design of a hierarchy.


@itemize *

@item 
If the GCC/LLVM backend was enabled during the compilation of GHDL, the elaboration command creates an executable containing the code of the VHDL sources, the elaboration code and simulation code to execute a design hierarchy. The executable is created in the current directory and the the filename is the name of the primary unit, or for the later case, the concatenation of the name of the primary unit, a dash, and the name of the secondary unit (or architecture). Option @code{-o} followed by a filename can override the default executable filename.

@item 
If mcode is used, this command elaborates the design but does not generate anything. Since the run command also elaborates the design, this con be skipped.
@end itemize

@geindex cmd run

@node Run [-r],Elaborate and run [--elab-run],Elaboration [-e],Design building commands
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL run-r}@anchor{3a}

@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-r}@anchor{2b}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}r <[options...] primary_unit [secondary_unit] [simulation_options...]>
@end deffn

Runs/simulates a design. The options and arguments are the same as for the elaboration command.


@itemize *

@item 
GGC/LLVM: simply, the filename of the executable is determined and it is executed. Options are ignored. You may also directly execute the program. The executable must be in the current directory.

@item 
mcode: the design is elaborated and the simulation is launched. As a consequence, you must use the same options used during analysis.
@end itemize

This command exists for three reasons:


@itemize *

@item 
You are using GCC/LLVM, but you don’t need to create the executable program name.

@item 
It is coherent with the @ref{37,,-a} and @ref{2a,,-e} commands.

@item 
It works with mcode implementation, where the executable code is generated in memory.
@end itemize

See section ‘@ref{3b,,Simulation and runtime}’, for details on options.

@end deffn

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
With GCC/LLVM, @ref{2a,,-e} should be used, and @ref{2b,,-r} with mcode.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

The files are first parsed, and then a elaboration is performed, which drives an analysis. Effectively, analysis and elaboration are combined, but there is no explicit call to @ref{37,,-a}. With GCC/LLVM, code is generated during the elaboration. With mcode, the simulation is launched after the elaboration.

All the units of the files are put into the @cite{work} library. But, the work library is neither read from disk nor saved. Therefore, you must give all the files of the @cite{work} library your design needs.

The advantages over the traditional approach (analyze and then elaborate) are:


@itemize *

@item 
The compilation cycle is achieved in one command.

@item 
Since the files are only parsed once, the compilation cycle may be faster.

@item 
You don’t need to know an analysis order.

@item 
This command produces smaller executable, since unused units and subprograms do not generate code.
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
However, you should know that currently most of the time is spent in code generation and the analyze and elaborate command generate code for all units needed, even units of @code{std} and @code{ieee} libraries.  Therefore, according to the design, the time for this command may be higher than the time for the analyze command followed by the elaborate command.
@end quotation

This command is still under development. In case of problems, you should go back to the traditional way.

@section Design rebuilding commands


Analyzing and elaborating a design consisting in several files can be tricky, due to dependencies. GHDL has a few commands to rebuild a design.

@geindex cmd importing files

@menu
* Import [-i]:: 
* Make [-m]:: 
* Generate Makefile [--gen-makefile]:: 
* Generate dependency file command [--gen-depends]:: 

@end menu

@node Import [-i],Make [-m],,Design rebuilding commands
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL import-i}@anchor{43}
@subsection Import [@code{-i}]


@geindex ghdl command line option; -i <[options] file...>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-i}@anchor{44}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}i <[options] file...>
@end deffn

All the files specified in the command line are scanned, parsed and added in the libraries but as not yet analyzed. No object files are created. It’s purpose is to localize design units in the design files. The make command will then be able to recursively build a hierarchy from an entity name or a configuration name.

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 

@itemize *

@item 
Note that all the files are added to the work library. If you have many libraries, you must use the command for each library.

@item 
Since the files are parsed, there must be correct files. However, since they are not analyzed, many errors are tolerated by this command.
@end itemize
@end quotation
@end cartouche

See @ref{45,,-m}, to actually build the design.

@geindex cmd make

@node Make [-m],Generate Makefile [--gen-makefile],Import [-i],Design rebuilding commands
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL make-m}@anchor{46}
@subsection Make [@code{-m}]


@geindex ghdl command line option; -m <[options] primary [secondary]>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-m}@anchor{45}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}m <[options] primary [secondary]>
@end deffn

Analyze automatically outdated files and elaborate a design. The primary unit denoted by the @code{primary} argument must already be known by the system, either because you have already analyzed it (even if you have modified it) or because you have imported it. A file may be outdated because it has been modified (e.g. you just have edited it), or because a design unit contained in the file depends on a unit which is outdated. This rule is of course recursive.


@itemize *

@item 
With option @ref{47,,--bind}, GHDL will stop before the final linking step. This is useful when the main entry point is not GHDL and you’re linking GHDL object files into a foreign program.

@item 
With option @ref{48,,-f} (force), GHDL analyzes all the units of the work library needed to create the design hierarchy. Not outdated units are recompiled.  This is useful if you want to compile a design hierarchy with new compilation flags (for example, to add the @emph{-g} debugging option).
@end itemize

The make command will only re-analyze design units in the work library. GHDL fails if it has to analyze an outdated unit from another library.

The purpose of this command is to be able to compile a design without prior knowledge of file order. In the VHDL model, some units must be analyzed before others (e.g. an entity before its architecture). It might be a nightmare to analyze a full design of several files, if you don’t have the ordered list of file. This command computes an analysis order.

The make command fails when a unit was not previously parsed. For example, if you split a file containing several design units into several files, you must either import these new files or analyze them so that GHDL knows in which file these units are.

The make command imports files which have been modified. Then, a design hierarchy is internally built as if no units are outdated. Then, all outdated design units, using the dependencies of the design hierarchy, are analyzed. If necessary, the design hierarchy is elaborated.

This is not perfect, since the default architecture (the most recently analyzed one) may change while outdated design files are analyzed. In such a case, re-run the make command of GHDL.

@geindex cmd generate makefile

@node Generate Makefile [--gen-makefile],Generate dependency file command [--gen-depends],Make [-m],Design rebuilding commands
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL generate-makefile-gen-makefile}@anchor{49}

@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}gen@w{-}makefile <[options] primary [secondary]>

This command works like the make command (see @ref{45,,-m}), but only a makefile is generated on the standard output.

@geindex --gen-depends command

@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}gen@w{-}depends <[options] primary [secondary]>
@end deffn

Generate a Makefile containing only dependencies to build a design unit.

This command works like the make and gen-makefile commands (see @ref{45,,-m}), but instead of a full makefile only dependencies without rules are generated on the standard output.
Theses rules can then be integrated in another Makefile.

@geindex WORK library

@geindex ghdl command line option; --work<=NAME>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-work}@anchor{4e}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}work<=NAME>

Specify the name of the @code{WORK} library.  Analyzed units are always placed in the library logically named @code{WORK}.  With this option, you can set its name.  By default, the name is @code{work}.

@cite{GHDL} checks whether @code{WORK} is a valid identifier. Although being more or less supported, the @code{WORK} identifier should not be an extended identifier, since the filesystem may prevent it from correctly working (due to case sensitivity or forbidden characters in filenames).

@cite{VHDL} rules forbid you to add units to the @code{std} library. Furthermore, you should not put units in the @code{ieee} library.
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --workdir<=DIR>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-workdir}@anchor{4f}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}workdir<=DIR>

Specify the directory where the @code{WORK} library is located. When this option is not present, the @code{WORK} library is in the current directory.  The object files created by the compiler are always placed in the same directory as the @code{WORK} library.

Use option @code{-P} to specify where libraries other than @code{WORK} are placed.
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --std<=STD>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-std}@anchor{50}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}std<=STD>

Specify the standard to use.  By default, the standard is @code{93c}, which means VHDL-93 accepting VHDL-87 syntax.  For details on @code{STD} values see section ‘@ref{51,,VHDL standards}’.

@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}ieee<=VER>

@geindex ieee library

@geindex synopsys library

@geindex mentor library

Select the @code{IEEE} library to use. @code{VER} must be one of:


@table @asis

@item none

Do not supply an @cite{IEEE} library.  Any library clause with the @code{IEEE}
identifier will fail, unless you have created by your own a library with
the @cite{IEEE} name.

@item standard

Supply an @cite{IEEE} library containing only packages defined by
@code{ieee} standards.  Currently, there are the multivalue logic system
packages @code{std_logic_1164} defined by IEEE 1164, the synthesis
packages , @code{numeric_bit} and @code{numeric_std} defined by IEEE
1076.3, and the @code{vital} packages @code{vital_timing} and
@code{vital_primitives}, defined by IEEE 1076.4.  The version of these
packages is defined by the VHDL standard used.  See section ‘@ref{53,,VITAL packages}’,
for more details.

@item synopsys

Supply the former packages and the following additional packages:
@code{std_logic_arith}, @code{std_logic_signed},
@code{std_logic_unsigned}, @code{std_logic_textio}.

These packages were created by some companies, and are popular.  However
they are not standard packages, and have been placed in the @cite{IEEE}
library without the permission from the @code{ieee}.

@item mentor

Supply the standard packages and the following additional package:
@code{std_logic_arith}.  The package is a slight variation of a definitely
not standard but widely mis-used package.
@end table

To avoid errors, you must use the same @cite{IEEE} library for all units of
your design, and during elaboration.
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; -P<DIRECTORY>
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-p-directory}@anchor{54}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}P<DIRECTORY>

Add @cite{DIRECTORY} to the end of the list of directories to be searched for
library files.  A library is searched in @cite{DIRECTORY} and also in
@cite{DIRECTORY/LIB/vVV} (where @cite{LIB} is the name of the library and @cite{VV}
the vhdl standard).

The @cite{WORK} library is always searched in the path specified by the
@code{--workdir} option, or in the current directory if the latter
option is not specified.
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; -fexplicit
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-fexplicit}@anchor{55}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}fexplicit

When two operators are overloaded, give preference to the explicit declaration.
This may be used to avoid the most common pitfall of the @code{std_logic_arith}
package.  See section ‘@ref{14,,IEEE library pitfalls}’, for an example.
@end deffn

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
This option is not set by default. I don’t think this option is a good feature, because it breaks the encapsulation rule.  When set, an operator can be silently overridden in another package.  You’d better fix your design and use the @code{numeric_std} package.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@geindex ghdl command line option; -frelaxed-rules
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-frelaxed-rules}@anchor{56}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}frelaxed@w{-}rules

Within an object declaration, allow to reference the name (which references the hidden declaration).  This ignores the error in the following code:

@example
package pkg1 is
 type state is (state1, state2, state3);
end pkg1;

use work.pkg1.all;
package pkg2 is
 constant state1 : state := state1;
end pkg2;
@end example

Some code (such as Xilinx packages) have such constructs, which are valid.

(The scope of the @code{state1} constant start at the @cite{constant} word. Because the constant @code{state1} and the enumeration literal @code{state1} are homograph, the enumeration literal is hidden in the immediate scope of the constant).

This option also relaxes the rules about pure functions. Violations result in warnings instead of errors.

@geindex ghdl command line option; -fpsl

@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}vital@w{-}checks

Disable or enable checks of restriction on VITAL units. Checks are enabled by default.

Checks are performed only when a design unit is decorated by a VITAL attribute. The VITAL attributes are @code{VITAL_Level0} and @code{VITAL_Level1}, both declared in the @code{ieee.VITAL_Timing} package.

Currently, VITAL checks are only partially implemented. See section ‘@ref{5b,,VHDL restrictions for VITAL}’ for more details.

During analyze, warns if a component instantiation has neither configuration specification nor default binding.  This may be useful if you want to detect during analyze possibly unbound component if you don’t use configuration. See section ‘@ref{51,,VHDL standards}’ for more details about default binding rules.

@geindex ghdl command line option; --warn-binding
@anchor{using/InvokingGHDL cmdoption-ghdl-warn-binding}@anchor{61}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}warn@w{-}binding

During elaboration, warns if a component instantiation is not bound (and not explicitly left unbound).  Also warns if a port of an entity is not bound in a configuration specification or in a component configuration. This warning is enabled by default, since default binding rules are somewhat complex and an unbound component is most often unexpected.

However, warnings are even emitted if a component instantiation is inside a generate statement. As a consequence, if you use the conditional generate statement to select a component according to the implementation, you will certainly get warnings.

Warns for checks that cannot be done during analysis time and are postponed to elaboration time.  This is because not all procedure bodies are available during analysis (either because a package body has not yet been analysed or because @cite{GHDL} doesn’t read not required package bodies).

These are checks for no wait statement in a procedure called in a sensitized process and checks for pure rules of a function.

@geindex create your own library

A new library is created implicitly, by compiling entities (packages etc.) into it: @code{ghdl -a --work=my_custom_lib my_file.vhd}.

A library’s source code is usually stored and compiled into its own directory, that you specify with the @code{--workdir} option: @code{ghdl -a --work=my_custom_lib --workdir=my_custom_libdir my_custom_lib_srcdir/my_file.vhd}. See also the @code{-P} command line option.

Furthermore, GHDL provides a few commands which act on a library:

@geindex cmd library directory

These commands simplify the compile and the link of a user vpi module. They are all wrapper: the arguments are in fact a whole command line that is executed with additional switches. Currently a unix-like compiler (like @cite{cc}, @cite{gcc} or @cite{clang}) is expected: the additional switches use their syntax. The only option is @cite{-v} which displays the

@section IEEE library pitfalls


When you use options @code{--ieee=synopsys} or @code{--ieee=mentor}, the @code{ieee} library contains non standard packages such as @code{std_logic_arith}. These packages are not standard because there are not described by an IEEE standard, even if they have been put in the @cite{IEEE} library. Furthermore, they are not really de-facto standard, because there are slight differences between the packages of Mentor and those of Synopsys. Furthermore, since they are not well-thought, their use has pitfalls. For example, this description has error during compilation:

@example
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

--  A counter from 0 to 10.
entity counter is
   port (val : out std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
         ck : std_logic;
         rst : std_logic);
end counter;

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;

architecture bad of counter
is
   signal v : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
begin
   process (ck, rst)
   begin
     if rst = '1' then
        v <= x"0";
     elsif rising_edge (ck) then
        if v = "1010" then -- Error
           v <= x"0";
        else
           v <= v + 1;
        end if;
     end if;
   end process;

   val <= v;
end bad;
@end example

When you analyze this design, GHDL does not accept it (too long lines
have been split for readability):

@example
ghdl -a --ieee=synopsys bad_counter.vhdl
bad_counter.vhdl:13:14: operator "=" is overloaded
bad_counter.vhdl:13:14: possible interpretations are:
../../libraries/ieee/std_logic_1164.v93:69:5: implicit function "="
    [std_logic_vector, std_logic_vector return boolean]
../../libraries/synopsys/std_logic_unsigned.vhdl:64:5: function "="
    [std_logic_vector, std_logic_vector return boolean]
../translate/ghdldrv/ghdl: compilation error
@end example

Indeed, the @cite{“=”} operator is defined in both packages, and both are visible at the place it is used.  The first declaration is an implicit one, which occurs when the @cite{std_logic_vector} type is declared and is an element to element comparison, the second one is an explicit declared function, with the semantic of an unsigned comparison.

With some analyser, the explicit declaration has priority over the implicit declaration, and this design can be analyzed without error.  However, this is not the rule given by the VHDL LRM, and since GHDL follows these rules,
it emits an error.

You can force GHDL to use this rule with the @emph{-fexplicit} option (see GHDL_options for further details). However it is easy to fix this error, by using a selected name:

@example
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;

architecture fixed_bad of counter
is
   signal v : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0);
begin
   process (ck, rst)
   begin
     if rst = '1' then
        v <= x"0";
     elsif rising_edge (ck) then
        if ieee.std_logic_unsigned."=" (v, "1010") then
           v <= x"0";
        else
           v <= v + 1;
        end if;
     end if;
   end process;

   val <= v;
end fixed_bad;
@end example

It is better to only use the standard packages defined by IEEE, which provides the same functionalities:

@example
library ieee;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

architecture good of counter
is
   signal v : unsigned (3 downto 0);
begin
   process (ck, rst)
   begin
     if rst = '1' then
        v <= x"0";
     elsif rising_edge (ck) then
        if v = "1010" then
           v <= x"0";
        else
           v <= v + 1;
        end if;
     end if;
   end process;

   val <= std_logic_vector (v);
end good;

@section Simulation options


In most system environments, it is possible to pass options while
invoking a program.  Contrary to most programming languages, there is no
standard method in VHDL to obtain the arguments or to set the exit
status.

In GHDL, it is impossible to pass parameters to your design.  A later version
could do it through the generics interfaces of the top entity.

However, the GHDL runtime behaviour can be modified with some options; for
example, it is possible to stop simulation after a certain time.

The exit status of the simulation is @code{EXIT_SUCCESS} (0) if the
simulation completes, or @code{EXIT_FAILURE} (1) in case of error
(assertion failure, overflow or any constraint error).

Here is the list of the most useful options.  Some debugging options are
also available, but not described here.  The @ref{8e,,--help} options lists
all options available, including the debugging one.

@geindex ghdl command line option; --assert-level<=LEVEL>
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-assert-level}@anchor{8f}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}assert@w{-}level<=LEVEL>

Select the assertion level at which an assertion violation stops the
simulation.  @cite{LEVEL} is the name from the @cite{severity_level}
enumerated type defined in the @cite{standard} package or the
@code{none} name.

By default, only assertion violation of severity level @code{failure}
stops the simulation.

For example, if @cite{LEVEL} was @code{warning}, any assertion violation
with severity level @code{warning}, @code{error} or @code{failure} would
stop simulation, but the assertion violation at the @code{note} severity
level would only display a message.

Option @code{--assert-level=none} prevents any assertion violation to stop
simulation.
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --ieee-asserts<=POLICY>
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-ieee-asserts}@anchor{90}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}ieee@w{-}asserts<=POLICY>

Select how the assertions from @code{ieee} units are
handled. @cite{POLICY} can be @code{enable} (the default),
@code{disable} which disables all assertion from @code{ieee} packages
and @code{disable-at-0} which disables only at start of simulation.

This option can be useful to avoid assertion message from
@code{ieee.numeric_std} (and other @code{ieee} packages).
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --stop-time<=TIME>
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-stop-time}@anchor{91}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}stop@w{-}time<=TIME>

Stop the simulation after @code{TIME}.  @code{TIME} is expressed as a time
value, @emph{without} any space.  The time is the simulation time, not
the real clock time.

For example:

@example
$ ./my_design --stop-time=10ns
$ ./my_design --stop-time=ps
@end example
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --stop-delta<=N>
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-stop-delta}@anchor{92}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}stop@w{-}delta<=N>

Stop the simulation after @cite{N} delta cycles in the same current time.

@geindex display time

@geindex ghdl command line option; --disp-time
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-disp-time}@anchor{93}

@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --unbuffered
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-unbuffered}@anchor{94}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}unbuffered

Disable buffering on stdout, stderr and files opened in write or append mode (TEXTIO).
@end deffn

@geindex ghdl command line option; --sdf<=PATH=FILENAME>
@anchor{using/Simulation cmdoption-ghdl-sdf}@anchor{95}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}sdf<=PATH=FILENAME>

Do VITAL annotation on @cite{PATH} with SDF file @code{FILENAME}.

@cite{PATH} is a path of instances, separated with @code{.} or @code{/}.
Any separator can be used.  Instances are component instantiation labels,
generate labels or block labels.  Currently, you cannot use an indexed name.

Specifying a delay:

@example
--sdf=min=PATH=FILENAME
--sdf=typ=PATH=FILENAME
--sdf=max=PATH=FILENAME
@end example

If the option contains a type of delay, that is @code{min=},
@code{typ=} or @code{max=}, the annotator use respectively minimum,
typical or maximum values.  If the option does not contain a type of delay,
the annotator use the typical delay.

See section ‘@ref{96,,Backannotation}’, for more details.

@geindex value change dump

@geindex dump of signals

Option @code{--vcd} dumps into the VCD file @cite{FILENAME} the signal
values before each non-delta cycle.  If @cite{FILENAME} is @code{-},
then the standard output is used, otherwise a file is created or
overwritten.

The @code{--vcdgz} option is the same as the @emph{–vcd} option,
but the output is compressed using the @cite{zlib} (@cite{gzip}
compression).  However, you can’t use the @code{-} filename.
Furthermore, only one VCD file can be written.

@emph{VCD} (value change dump) is a file format defined
by the @cite{verilog} standard and used by virtually any wave viewer.

Since it comes from @cite{verilog}, only a few VHDL types can be dumped.  GHDL
dumps only signals whose base type is of the following:


@itemize *

@item 
types defined in the @code{std.standard} package:

@item 
@code{bit}

@item 
@code{bit_vector}

@item 
types defined in the @code{ieee.std_logic_1164} package:

@item 
@code{std_ulogic}

@item 
@code{std_logic} (because it is a subtype of @code{std_ulogic})

@item 
@code{std_ulogic_vector}

@item 
@code{std_logic_vector}

@item 
any integer type
@end itemize

I have successfully used @cite{gtkwave} to view VCD files.

Currently, there is no way to select signals to be dumped: all signals are
dumped, which can generate big files.

It is very unfortunate there is no standard or well-known wave file
format supporting VHDL types.  If you are aware of such a free format,
please mail me (@ref{12,,Reporting bugs}).

the signals are dumped into the waveform file, you cannot select a hierarchy
of signals to be dumped.

The format of this file was defined by myself and is not yet completely fixed.
It may change slightly.  The @code{gtkwave} tool can read the GHW files.

Contrary to VCD files, any VHDL type can be dumped into a GHW file.

To easily navigate through your sources, you may generate cross-references. This command generates an html file for each @code{file} given in the command line, with syntax highlighting and full cross-reference: every identifier is a link to its declaration. Besides, an index of the files is created too.

The set of @code{file} are analyzed, and then, if the analysis is successful, html files are generated in the directory specified by the @code{-o} option, or @code{html/} directory by default.


@itemize *

@item 
If the option @code{--format=html2} is specified, then the generated html files follow the HTML 2.0 standard, and colours are specified with @cite{<FONT>} tags. However, colours are hard-coded.

@item 
If the option @code{--format=css} is specified, then the generated html files follow the HTML 4.0 standard, and use the CSS-1 file @code{ghdl.css} to specify colours. This file is generated only if it does not already exist (it is never overwritten) and can be customized by the user to change colours or appearance. Refer to a generated file and its comments for more information.

Debugging VHDL programs using @cite{GDB} is possible only with GCC/LLVM.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

GDB is a general purpose debugger for programs compiled by GCC. Currently, there is no VHDL support for GDB. It may be difficult to inspect variables or signals in GDB. However, it is still able to display the stack frame in case of error or to set a breakpoint at a specified line.

GDB can be useful to precisely catch a runtime error, such as indexing an array beyond its bounds. All error check subprograms call the @code{__ghdl_fatal} procedure. Therefore, to catch runtime error, set a breakpoint like this:

@example
(gdb) break __ghdl_fatal
@end example

When the breakpoint is hit, use the @code{where} or @code{bt} command to display the stack frames.

GHDL can be downloaded (cloned) with @code{git clone} from GitHub. GitHub offers
the transfer protocols HTTPS and SSH. You should use SSH if you have a GitHub
account and have already uploaded an OpenSSH public key to GitHub, otherwise
use HTTPS if you have no account or you want to use login credentials.

The created folder @code{<GitRoot>\ghdl} is used as @code{<GHDLRoot>} in
later instructions or on other pages in this documentation.

@subheading Download


GHDL can be downloaded as a zip-file@footnote{https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/archive/master.zip}
(latest ‘master’ branch) or cloned with @code{git clone} from GitHub. GitHub
offers HTTPS and SSH as transfer protocols. See the @ref{bb,,Downloading Source Files}
page for further details. The installation directory is referred to as @code{GHDLRoot}.

@subheading Available back-ends


GHDL currently supports three different back-ends (code generators):


@itemize *

@item 
mcode - built-in x86(or x86_64) code generator,

@item 
GCC - Gnu Compiler Collection@footnote{http://gcc.gnu.org/}, and

@item 
LLVM - Low-Level Virtual Machine@footnote{http://llvm.org/} .
@end itemize

Here is a short comparison, so that you can choose the one you want to use:

On Linux, GHDL is configured by @code{configure} and build by @code{make}.


@itemize *

@item 
First, GHDL needs to be configured. It is common to specify a @code{PREFIX}
(installation directory like @code{/usr/local} or @code{/opt/ghdl}). Without any
other option, @code{configure} select @cite{mcode} as backend.

@item 
Next, @code{make} starts the compilation process.

@item 
Finally, @code{make install} installs GHDL into the installation directory
specified by @code{PREFIX}. You may need super user privileges (@code{sudo ...}).

@quotation Hint 
Once GCC (with GHDL) has been built once, it is possible to work on the GHDL source tree without copying it in the GCC tree. Commands are:

@example
$ make ghdl1-gcc           # Build the compiler
$ make ghdl_gcc            # Build the driver
$ make libs.vhdl.local_gcc # Compile the vhdl libraries
$ make grt-all             # Build the GHDL runtime
$ make grt.links           # Locally install the GHDL runtime
@end example

In @code{src/ortho/gcc}, create a @code{Makefile.conf} file that sets the following
variables:

@example
AGCC_GCCSRC_DIR=/path/to/gcc/sources
AGCC_GCCOBJ_DIR=/path/to/gcc/build
@end example
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
For ppc64 (and AIX ?) platform, the object file format contains an identifier for the source language. Because gcc doesn’t know about the VHDL, gcc crashes very early. This could be fixed with a very simple change in @code{gcc/config/rs6000/rs6000.c}, @code{function rs6000_output_function_epilogue} (as of gcc 4.8):

@example
else if (! strcmp (language_string, "GNU Objective-C"))
        i = 14;
else
-  gcc_unreachable ();
+  i = 0;
fprintf (file, "%d,", i);

@subsection GCC Backend on GNU/Linux with GCC/GNAT


@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
There are some dependencies for building GCC (@code{gmp}, @code{mpfr} and @code{mpc}). If you have not them installed on your system, you can either build them manually or use the @code{download_prerequisites} script provided in the GCC source tree (recommended): @code{cd /path/to/gcc/source/dir && ./contrib/download_prerequisites}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@itemize *

@item 
First configure GHDL, specify GCC source directory and @code{PREFIX} (installation directory like  @code{/usr/local} or @code{/opt/ghdl}).

@item 
Next, invoke @code{make} to copy GHDL sources in the source directory.

@item 
Then, configure GCC. The list of @code{--disable} configure options can be adjusted to your needs. GHDL does not require all these optional libraries and disabling them will speed-up the build.

@item 
Now, build and install GCC with @code{make}.

@item 
Last, build and install GHDL libraries.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Example:


@example
$ cd <ghdl>
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure --with-gcc=/path/to/gcc/source/dir --prefix=PREFIX
$ make copy-sources
$ mkdir gcc-objs; cd gcc-objs
$ /path/to/gcc/source/dir/configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-languages=c,vhdl \
--disable-bootstrap --disable-lto --disable-multilib --disable-libssp \
--disable-libgomp --disable-libquadmath
$ make -j2 && make install
$ cd /path/to/ghdl/source/dir
$ make ghdllib
$ make install
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
Note that the prefix directory must be the same as the one used to configure GHDL. If you have manually built @code{gmp}/@code{mpfr}/@code{mpc} (without using the script in @code{contrib}) and if you have installed them in a non-standard directory, you may need to add @code{--with-gmp=GMP_INSTALL_DIR}.

@end quotation

@c #
@c On Windows with MinGW, GHDL is configured by ``configure`` and build by ``make``.
@c 
@c * First, GHDL needs to be configured. It is common to specify a ``PREFIX``
@c   (installation directory like ``/usr/local`` or ``/opt/ghdl``). Without any
@c   other option, ``configure`` select `mcode` as backend.
@c 
@c * Next, ``make`` starts the compilation process.
@c 
@c * Finally, ``make install`` installs GHDL into the installation directory
@c   specified by ``PREFIX``.
@c 
@c .. rubric:: Example:
@c 
@c .. code-block:: Bash
@c 
@c    $ cd <ghdl>
@c    $ mkdir build
@c    $ cd build
@c    $ ../configure --prefix=PREFIX
@c    $ make
@c    $ make install

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
The output of both GCC and LLVM is an executable file, but @cite{mcode} does not
generate any. Therefore, if using GCC/LLVM, the call with argument @code{-r} can
be replaced with direct execution of the binary. See section @ref{d,,Quick Start Guide}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

After making your choice, you can jump to the corresponding section.
However, we suggest you to read @ref{1a,,Directory Structure} before, so that you
know where the content is placed and which temporal files are expected to be
created.

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
Since GHDL is written in @cite{Ada}, independently of the code generator you use,
the @cite{GNU Ada compiler}, @cite{GNAT GPL}, is required, 2014 (or later) for @code{x86}
(32 or 64 bits). @cite{GNAT GPL} can be downloaded anonymously from libre.adacore.com@footnote{http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gnat-gpl-edition/}.
Then, untar and run the doinstall script. Alternatively, most GNU/Linux
provide a package named @code{gcc-ada} or @code{gcc-gnat}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
In these instructions, the configure script is executed in the source directory; but you can execute in a different
directory too, like this:

$ cd ghdl-objs

@chapter Precompile Vendor Primitives


Vendors like Altera, Lattice and Xilinx have their own simulation libraries,
especially for FPGA primitives, soft and hard macros. These libraries can not
be shipped with @emph{GHDL}, but we offer prepared compile scripts to pre-compile
the vendor libraries, if the vendor tool is present on the computer. There are
also popular simulation and verification libraries like OSVVM @footnote{
OSVVM @indicateurl{http://github.com/OSVVM/OSVVM}
}, VUnit
@footnote{
VUnit @indicateurl{https://github.com/VUnit/vunit}
} or UVVM @footnote{
UVVM @indicateurl{https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM_All}
}, which can be pre-compiled, too.

The compilation scripts are writen in the shell languages: @emph{PowerShell} for
@emph{Windows} ™ and @emph{Bash} for @emph{GNU/Linux}. The compile scripts can colorize
the GHDL warning and error lines with the help of @cite{grc/grcat} @footnote{
Generic Colourizer @indicateurl{http://kassiopeia.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/grc.html}
}.

@node Script Configuration,Compiling on Linux,Supported Simulation and Verification Libraries,Precompile Vendor Primitives
@anchor{building/PrecompileVendorPrimitives script-configuration}@anchor{ee}
@section Script Configuration


The vendor library compile scripts need to know where the used / latest vendor
tool chain is installed. Therefore, the script implement a default installation
directory search as well as environment variable checks. If a vendor tool could
not be detected or the script choses the wrong vendor library source directory,
then it’s possible to provide the path via @cite{–source} or @cite{-Source}.

The generated output is stored relative to the current working directory. The
scripts create a sub-directory for each vendor. The default output directory can
be overwritten by the parameter @cite{–output} or @cite{-Output}.

To compile all source files with GHDL, the simulator executable is searched in
@cite{PATH}. The found default GHDL executable can be overwritten by setting the
environment variable @cite{GHDL} or by passing the parameter @cite{–ghdl} or @cite{-GHDL} to
the scripts.

If the vendor library compilation is used very often, we recommend to configure
these parameters in @cite{config.sh} or @cite{config.psm1}, so the command line can be
shortened to the essential parts.

The following commands act on one or several files. These are not analyzed, therefore, they work even if a file has semantic errors.

@anchor{references/CommandReference cmdoption-ghdl-pp-html}@anchor{103}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}pp@w{-}html <[options] file...>
@end deffn

The files are just scanned and an html file, with syntax highlighting is generated on standard output. Since the files are not even parsed, erroneous files or incomplete designs can be pretty printed.

The style of the html file can be modified with the @code{--format=} option:


@itemize *

@item 
By default or when the @code{--format=html2} option is specified, the output is an HTML 2.0 file, with colours set through @cite{<FONT>} tags.

@item 
When the @code{--format=css} option is specified, the output is an HTML 4.0 file, with colours set through a CSS file, whose name is @code{ghdl.css}. See Cross-reference_command, for more details about this CSS file.
@end itemize

@end deffn

The files are scanned, parsed and the names of design units are displayed. Design units marked with two stars are candidate to be at the apex of a design hierarchy.

@anchor{references/CommandReference cmdoption-ghdl-chop}@anchor{106}
@deffn {Option} @w{-}@w{-}chop <files...>
@end deffn

The provided files are read, and a file is written in the current directory for every design unit. Each filename is build according to the type:


@itemize *

@item 
For an entity declaration, a package declaration or a configuration the file name is @code{NAME.vhdl}, where @cite{NAME} is the name of the design unit.

@item 
For a package body, the filename is @code{NAME-body.vhdl}.

@item 
Finally, for an architecture @cite{ARCH} of an entity @cite{ENTITY}, the filename is @code{ENTITY-ARCH.vhdl}.
@end itemize

Since the input files are parsed, this command aborts in case of syntax error. The command aborts too if a file to be written already exists.

Comments between design units are stored into the most adequate files.

This command may be useful to split big files, if your computer has not enough memory to compile such files. The size of the executable is reduced too.

@chapter Coding Style


Ada subset: use only a simple (VHDL like) subset of Ada: no tasking, no
controlled types…  VHDL users should easily understand that subset.
Allowed Ada95 features: the standard library, child packages.
Use assertions.

We try to follow the ‘GNU Coding Standards’ when possible: comments before
declarations, two spaces at end of sentences, finish sentences with a dot.
But: 3 spaces for indentation.

No trailing spaces, not TAB (HT).

Subprograms must have a comment before to describe it, like:

@example
--  Analyze the concurrent statements of PARENT.
procedure Sem_Concurrent_Statement_Chain (Parent : Iir);
@end example

The line before the comment must be a blank line (unless this is the first
declaration).  Don’t repeat the comment before the subprogram body.


@itemize *

@item 
For subprograms:


@enumerate 

@item 
Declare on one line when possible:

@example
function Translate_Static_Aggregate (Aggr : Iir) return O_Cnode
@end example

@item 
If not possible, put the return on the next line:

@example
function Translate_Static_String (Str_Type : Iir; Str_Ident : Name_Id)
                                 return O_Cnode
@end example

@item 
If not possible, put parameters and return on the next line:

@example
function Create_String_Literal_Var_Inner
  (Str : Iir; Element_Type : Iir; Str_Type : O_Tnode) return Var_Type
@end example

@item 
If not possible, return on the next line:

@example
function Translate_Shortcut_Operator
  (Imp : Iir_Implicit_Function_Declaration; Left, Right : Iir)
  return O_Enode
@end example

@item 
If not possible, one parameter per line, just after subprogram name:

@example
procedure Translate_Static_Aggregate_1 (List : in out O_Array_Aggr_List;
                                        Aggr : Iir;
                                        Info : Iir;
                                        El_Type : Iir)
@end example

@item 
If not possible, add a return after subprogram name:

@example
function Translate_Predefined_TF_Array_Element
  (Op : Predefined_Boolean_Logical;
   Left, Right : Iir;
   Res_Type : Iir;
   Loc : Iir)
  return O_Enode
@end example
@end enumerate


@enumerate 7

@item 
If not possible, ask yourself what is wrong!  Shorten a name.
@end enumerate

@item 
Rule for the ‘is’: one a new line only if the declarative part is not empty:

@quotation

@example
procedure Translate_Assign (Target : Mnode; Expr : Iir; Target_Type : Iir)
is
   Val : O_Enode;
begin
@end example
@end quotation

vs.

@quotation

@example
function Translate_Static_Range_Dir (Expr : Iir) return O_Cnode is
begin
@end example
@end quotation

If the parametere line is too long with the ‘is’, put in on a separate line:

@quotation

@example
procedure Predeclare_Scope_Type
  (Scope : in out Var_Scope_Type; Name : O_Ident) is
@end example
@end quotation

@item 
Generic instantiation: put the generic actual part on a new line:

@quotation

@example
procedure Free is new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation
  (Action_List, Action_List_Acc);
@end example
@end quotation

@item 
For if/then statement:


@enumerate 

@item 
‘then’ on the same line:

@example
if Get_Expr_Staticness (Decl) = Locally then
@end example

@item 
If not possible, ‘then’ is alone on its line aligned with the ‘if’:

@example
if Expr = Null_Iir
  or else Get_Kind (Expr) = Iir_Kind_Overflow_Literal
then
@end example

@item 
For a multiline condition, ‘or else’ and ‘and then’ should start lines.
@end enumerate

@item 
‘Local’ variable declaration:
Do not initialize variables, constants must be declared before variables:

@quotation

@example
is
   N_Info : constant Iir := Get_Sub_Aggregate_Info (Info);
   Assoc  : Iir;
   Sub    : Iir;
begin
@end example

If the initialization expression has a side effect (such as allocation), do
not use a constant.

This is very unfortunate, but there are many versions of the VHDL
language, and they aren’t backward compatible.

The VHDL language was first standardized in 1987 by IEEE as IEEE 1076-1987, and
is commonly referred as VHDL-87. This is certainly the most important version,
since most of the VHDL tools are still based on this standard.

Various problems of this first standard have been analyzed by experts groups
to give reasonable ways of interpreting the unclear portions of the standard.

VHDL was revised in 1993 by IEEE as IEEE 1076-1993.  This revision is still
well-known.

Unfortunately, VHDL-93 is not fully compatible with VHDL-87, i.e. some perfectly
valid VHDL-87 programs are invalid VHDL-93 programs.  Here are some of the
reasons:


@itemize *

@item 
the syntax of file declaration has changed (this is the most visible source
of incompatibility),

@item 
new keywords were introduced (group, impure, inertial, literal,
postponed, pure, reject, rol, ror, shared, sla, sll, sra, srl,
unaffected, xnor),

@item 
some dynamic behaviours have changed (the concatenation is one of them),

@item 
rules have been added.
@end itemize

Shared variables were replaced by protected types in the 2000 revision of
the VHDL standard.  This modification is also known as 1076a.  Note that this
standard is not fully backward compatible with VHDL-93, since the type of a
shared variable must now be a protected type (there was no such restriction
before).

Minors corrections were added by the 2002 revision of the VHDL standard.  This
revision is not fully backward compatible with VHDL-00 since, for example,
the value of the @cite{‘instance_name} attribute has slightly changed.

The latest version is 2008.  Many features have been added, and GHDL
doesn’t implement all of them.

You can select the VHDL standard expected by GHDL with the
@code{--std=VER} option, where @code{VER} is one of the left column of the
table below:


@table @asis

@item 87

Select VHDL-87 standard as defined by IEEE 1076-1987.  LRM bugs corrected by
later revisions are taken into account.

@item 93

Select VHDL-93; VHDL-87 file declarations are not accepted.

@item 93c

Select VHDL-93 standard with relaxed rules:


@itemize *

@item 
VHDL-87 file declarations are accepted;

@item 
default binding indication rules of VHDL-02 are used.  Default binding rules
are often used, but they are particularly obscure before VHDL-02.
@end itemize

@item 00

Select VHDL-2000 standard, which adds protected types.

@item 02

Select VHDL-2002 standard

@item 08

Select VHDL-2008 standard (partially implemented).
@end table

The 93, 93c, 00 and 02 standards are considered as compatible: you can
elaborate a design mixing these standards.  However, 87, 93 and 08 are
not compatible.

@node PSL implementation,Source representation,VHDL standards,Implementation of VHDL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL id2}@anchor{11d}@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL psl-implementation}@anchor{58}
@section PSL implementation


GHDL understands embedded PSL annotations in VHDL files, but not in
separate files.

As PSL annotations are embedded within comments, you must analyze and elaborate
your design with option @emph{-fpsl} to enable PSL annotations.

A PSL assertion statement must appear within a comment that starts
with the @cite{psl} keyword.  The keyword must be followed (on the
same line) by a PSL keyword such as @cite{assert} or @cite{default}.
To continue a PSL statement on the next line, just start a new comment.

A PSL statement is considered as a process.  So it is not allowed within
a process.

All PSL assertions must be clocked (GHDL doesn’t support unclocked assertion).
Furthermore only one clock per assertion is allowed.

You can either use a default clock like this:

@example
-- psl default clock is rising_edge (CLK);
-- psl assert always
--   a -> eventually! b;
@end example

or use a clocked expression (note the use of parenthesis):

@example
-- psl assert (always a -> next[3](b)) @@rising_edge (clk);
@end example

Of course only the simple subset of PSL is allowed.

Currently the built-in functions are not implemented.

@node Source representation,Library database,PSL implementation,Implementation of VHDL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL source-representation}@anchor{11e}
@section Source representation


According to the VHDL standard, design units (i.e. entities,
architectures, packages, package bodies and configurations) may be
independently analyzed.

Several design units may be grouped into a design file.

In GHDL, a system file represents a design file.  That is, a file compiled by
GHDL may contain one or more design units.

It is common to have several design units in a design file.

GHDL does not impose any restriction on the name of a design file
(except that the filename may not contain any control character or
spaces).

GHDL do not keep a binary representation of the design units analyzed like
other VHDL analyzers.  The sources of the design units are re-read when
needed (for example, an entity is re-read when one of its architecture is
analyzed).  Therefore, if you delete or modify a source file of a unit
analyzed, GHDL will refuse to use it.

@node Library database,Top entity,Source representation,Implementation of VHDL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL library-database}@anchor{11f}@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL id3}@anchor{120}
@section Library database


Each design unit analyzed is placed into a design library.  By default,
the name of this design library is @code{work}; however, this can be
changed with the @code{--work=NAME} option of GHDL.

To keep the list of design units in a design library, GHDL creates
library files.  The name of these files is @code{NAME-objVER.cf}, where
@cite{NAME} is the name of the library, and @cite{VER} the VHDL version (87,
93 or 08) used to analyze the design units.

You don’t have to know how to read a library file.  You can display it
using the @emph{-d} of @cite{ghdl}.  The file contains the name of the
design units, as well as the location and the dependencies.

The format may change with the next version of GHDL.

@node Top entity,Using vendor libraries,Library database,Implementation of VHDL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL top-entity}@anchor{39}@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL id4}@anchor{121}
@section Top entity


There are some restrictions on the entity being at the apex of a design
hierarchy:


@itemize *

@item 
The generic must have a default value, and the value of a generic is its
default value;

@item 
The ports type must be constrained.

@section Using vendor libraries


Many vendors libraries have been analyzed with GHDL.  There are
usually no problems.  Be sure to use the @code{--work=} option.
However, some problems have been encountered.

GHDL follows the VHDL LRM (the manual which defines VHDL) more
strictly than other VHDL tools.  You could try to relax the
restrictions by using the @code{--std=93c}, @code{-fexplicit},
@code{-frelaxed-rules} and @code{--warn-no-vital-generic}.

@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVHDL foreign-declarations}@anchor{124}
@subsection Foreign declarations


Only subprograms (functions or procedures) can be imported, using the foreign
attribute.  In this example, the @cite{sin} function is imported:

@example
package math is
  function sin (v : real) return real;
  attribute foreign of sin : function is "VHPIDIRECT sin";
end math;

package body math is
  function sin (v : real) return real is
  begin
    assert false severity failure;
  end sin;
end math;
@end example

A subprogram is made foreign if the @cite{foreign} attribute decorates
it.  This attribute is declared in the 1993 revision of the
@code{std.standard} package.  Therefore, you cannot use this feature in
VHDL 1987.

The decoration is achieved through an attribute specification.  The
attribute specification must be in the same declarative part as the
subprogram and must be after it.  This is a general rule for specifications.
The value of the specification must be a locally static string.

Even when a subprogram is foreign, its body must be present.  However, since
it won’t be called, you can made it empty or simply but an assertion.

The value of the attribute must start with @code{VHPIDIRECT} (an
upper-case keyword followed by one or more blanks).  The linkage name of the
subprogram follows.

@subsection Restrictions on foreign declarations


Any subprogram can be imported.  GHDL puts no restrictions on foreign
subprograms.  However, the representation of a type or of an interface in a
foreign language may be obscure.  Most of non-composite types are easily imported:


@table @asis

@item @emph{integer types}

They are represented on a 32 bits word.  This generally corresponds to
@cite{int} for @cite{C} or @cite{Integer} for @cite{Ada}.

@item @emph{physical types}

They are represented on a 64 bits word.  This generally corresponds to the
@cite{long long} for @cite{C} or @cite{Long_Long_Integer} for @cite{Ada}.

@item @emph{floating point types}

They are represented on a 64 bits floating point word.  This generally
corresponds to @cite{double} for @cite{C} or @cite{Long_Float} for @cite{Ada}.

@item @emph{enumeration types}

They are represented on 8 bits or 32 bits word, if the number of literals is
greater than 256.  There is no corresponding C types, since arguments are
not promoted.
@end table

Non-composite types are passed by value.  For the @cite{in} mode, this
corresponds to the @cite{C} or @cite{Ada} mechanism.  The @cite{out} and
@cite{inout} interfaces of non-composite types are gathered in a record
and this record is passed by reference as the first argument to the
subprogram.  As a consequence, you shouldn’t use @cite{in} and
@cite{inout} modes in foreign subprograms, since they are not portable.

Records are represented like a @cite{C} structure and are passed by reference
to subprograms.

Arrays with static bounds are represented like a @cite{C} array, whose
length is the number of elements, and are passed by reference to subprograms.

Unconstrained array are represented by a fat pointer.  Do not use unconstrained
arrays in foreign subprograms.

Accesses to an unconstrained array is a fat pointer.  Other accesses correspond to an address and are passed to a subprogram like other non-composite types.

Files are represented by a 32 bits word, which corresponds to an index
in a table.

You may add additional files or options during the link using the
@emph{-Wl,} of @cite{GHDL}, as described in Elaboration_command.
For example:

@example
ghdl -e -Wl,-lm math_tb
@end example

will create the @code{math_tb} executable with the @code{lm} (mathematical)
library.

Note the @code{c} library is always linked with an executable.

You may run your design from an external program.  You just have to call
the @code{ghdl_main} function which can be defined:

in C:

@example
extern int ghdl_main (int argc, char **argv);
@end example

in Ada:

@example
with System;
...
function Ghdl_Main (Argc : Integer; Argv : System.Address)
   return Integer;
pragma import (C, Ghdl_Main, "ghdl_main");
@end example

This function must be called once, and returns 0 at the end of the simulation.
In case of failure, this function does not return.  This has to be fixed.

@subsection Linking with Ada


As explained previously in @ref{12a,,Starting a simulation from a foreign program},
you can start a simulation from an @cite{Ada} program.  However the build
process is not trivial: you have to elaborate your @cite{Ada} program and your
@cite{VHDL} design.

First, you have to analyze all your design files.  In this example, we
suppose there is only one design file, @code{design.vhdl}.

@example
$ ghdl -a design.vhdl
@end example

Then, bind your design.  In this example, we suppose the entity at the
design apex is @code{design}.

@example
$ ghdl --bind design
@end example

Finally, compile, bind your @cite{Ada} program at link it with your @cite{VHDL}
design:

@example
$ gnatmake my_prog -largs `ghdl --list-link design`
@end example

@subsection Using GRT from Ada


@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
This topic is only for advanced users knowing how to use @cite{Ada}
and @cite{GNAT}.  This is provided only for reference, I have tested
this once before releasing @cite{GHDL} 0.19 but this is not checked at
each release.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

The simulator kernel of @cite{GHDL} named @emph{GRT} is written in
@cite{Ada95} and contains a very light and slightly adapted version
of @cite{VHPI}.  Since it is an @cite{Ada} implementation it is
called @emph{AVHPI}. Although being tough, you may interface to @cite{AVHPI}.

For using @cite{AVHPI}, you need the sources of @cite{GHDL} and to recompile
them (at least the @cite{GRT} library).  This library is usually compiled with
a @cite{No_Run_Time} pragma, so that the user does not need to install the
@cite{GNAT} runtime library.  However, you certainly want to use the usual
runtime library and want to avoid this pragma.  For this, reset the
@cite{GRT_PRAGMA_FLAG} variable.

@example
$ make GRT_PRAGMA_FLAG= grt-all
@end example

Since @cite{GRT} is a self-contained library, you don’t want
@cite{gnatlink} to fetch individual object files (furthermore this
doesn’t always work due to tricks used in @cite{GRT}).  For this,
remove all the object files and make the @code{.ali} files read-only.

@example
$ rm *.o
$ chmod -w *.ali
@end example

You may then install the sources files and the @code{.ali} files.  I have never
tested this step.

You are now ready to use it.

For example, here is an example, @code{test_grt.adb} which displays the top
level design name.

@example
with System; use System;
with Grt.Avhpi; use Grt.Avhpi;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Ghdl_Main;

procedure Test_Grt is
   --  VHPI handle.
   H : VhpiHandleT;
   Status : Integer;

   --  Name.
   Name : String (1 .. 64);
   Name_Len : Integer;
begin
   --  Elaborate and run the design.
   Status := Ghdl_Main (0, Null_Address);

   --  Display the status of the simulation.
   Put_Line ("Status is " & Integer'Image (Status));

   --  Get the root instance.
   Get_Root_Inst(H);

   --  Disp its name using vhpi API.
   Vhpi_Get_Str (VhpiNameP, H, Name, Name_Len);
   Put_Line ("Root instance name: " & Name (1 .. Name_Len));
end Test_Grt;
@end example

First, analyze and bind your design:

@example
$ ghdl -a counter.vhdl
$ ghdl --bind counter
@end example

Then build the whole:

@example
$ gnatmake test_grt -aL`grt_ali_path` -aI`grt_src_path` -largs
 `ghdl --list-link counter`
@end example

Finally, run your design:

@example
$ ./test_grt
Status is  0
Root instance name: counter
@end example

@section VITAL packages


The VITAL standard or IEEE 1076.4 was first published in 1995, and revised in
2000.

The version of the VITAL packages depends on the VHDL standard.  VITAL
1995 packages are used with the VHDL 1987 standard, while VITAL 2000
packages are used with other standards.  This choice is based on the
requirements of VITAL: VITAL 1995 requires the models follow the VHDL
1987 standard, while VITAL 2000 requires the models follow VHDL 1993.

The VITAL 2000 packages were slightly modified so that they conform to
the VHDL 1993 standard (a few functions are made pure and a few one
impure).

@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVITAL id2}@anchor{131}@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVITAL vhdl-restrictions-for-vital}@anchor{5b}
@section VHDL restrictions for VITAL


The VITAL standard (partially) implemented is the IEEE 1076.4 standard
published in 1995.

This standard defines restriction of the VHDL language usage on VITAL
model.  A @emph{VITAL model} is a design unit (entity or architecture)
decorated by the @cite{VITAL_Level0} or @cite{VITAL_Level1} attribute.
These attributes are defined in the @cite{ieee.VITAL_Timing} package.

Currently, only VITAL level 0 checks are implemented.  VITAL level 1 models
can be analyzed, but GHDL doesn’t check they comply with the VITAL standard.

Moreover, GHDL doesn’t check (yet) that timing generics are not read inside
a VITAL level 0 model prior the VITAL annotation.

The analysis of a non-conformant VITAL model fails.  You can disable the
checks of VITAL restrictions with the @emph{–no-vital-checks}.  Even when
restrictions are not checked, SDF annotation can be performed.

@node Backannotation,Negative constraint calculation,VHDL restrictions for VITAL,Implementation of VITAL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVITAL backannotation}@anchor{96}@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVITAL id3}@anchor{132}
@section Backannotation


@geindex SDF

@emph{Backannotation} is the process of setting VITAL generics with timing
information provided by an external files.

The external files must be SDF (Standard Delay Format) files.  GHDL
supports a tiny subset of SDF version 2.1, other version number can be
used, provided no features added by the next version are used.

Hierarchical instance names are not supported. However you can use a list of
instances.  If there is no instance, the top entity will be annotated and
the celltype must be the name of the top entity.  If there is at least one
instance, the last instance name must be a component instantiation label, and
the celltype must be the name of the component declaration instantiated.

Instances being annotated are not required to be VITAL compliant.  However
generics being annotated must follow rules of VITAL (e.g., type must be a
suitable vital delay type).

Currently, only timing constraints applying on a timing generic of type
@cite{VitalDelayType01} has been implemented.  This SDF annotator is
just a proof of concept.  Features will be added with the following GHDL
release.

@node Negative constraint calculation,,Backannotation,Implementation of VITAL
@anchor{references/ImplementationOfVITAL negative-constraint-calculation}@anchor{133}
@section Negative constraint calculation


Negative constraint delay adjustment are necessary to handle negative
constraint such as a negative setup time.  This step is defined in the VITAL
standard and should occur after backannotation.

GHDL does not do negative constraint calculation.  It fails to handle models
with negative constraint.  I hope to be able to add this phase soon.

It’s better for version control systems and diff tools to break lines at a sensible number of characters. Long lines appear as one diff. Also merging is more complex because merges are line based. Long unbreakable items may be longer (links, refs, …). We chose to use 160 chars.

@quotation

@quotation
@end quotation

@code{print 1+@emph{variable}}

@item 
A documentation should not use “you”, “we”, …, because it’s not an interactive conversation or informal letter. It’s like a thesis, everything is structured and formal. However, to make it more friendly to newcomers, we agree to allow informal language in section ‘@ref{d,,Quick Start Guide}’.

I prefer a text block, which explains how a compilation works, what I can configure for that backend, etc. After that, I prefer a code block with e.g. bash instructions on how to compile a backend. A list of instructions with embedded bash lines is not helpful. An experienced, as well as novice user, would like to copy a set of instructions into the shell. But it should be stated what these instructions will do. Complex flows like for GCC, can be split into multiple shell code blocks. Moreover, I find it essential, to demonstrate when and where to change directories.

We would like to see a list like

@item 
gcc (Gnu Compiler Collection)

@item 
gcc-gnat (Ada compiler for GCC)

@item 
llvm-del (LLVM development package)

@item 
…
@end itemize

The goal is to also explain what a user is installing and what the few lines in the build description do. Now they know the name, can search for similar names if the have another package manager or distro or can ask Google/Wikipedia. We often find many build receipts with cryptic shell code and to execute this unknown stuff with sudo is not comfortable. We would like to know what it does before hiting enter.
