The GHDL front-end, the :samp:`std.textio` package and the runtime
library (:samp:`grt`) are copyrighted Tristan Gingold, come with **absolutely
no warranty**, and are distributed under the conditions of the General
Public License.

The :samp:`ieee.numeric_bit` and :samp:`ieee.numeric_std` packages are
copyrighted by the IEEE.  The source files may be distributed without
change, except as permitted by the standard.

This source file may not be
sold or distributed for profit.  See the source file and the IEEE 1076.3
standard for more information.

The :samp:`ieee.std_logic_1164`, :samp:`ieee.Math_Real` and
:samp:`ieee.Math_Complex` packages are copyrighted by the IEEE.  See
source files for more information.

The :samp:`ieee.VITAL_Primitives`, :samp:`ieee.VITAL_Timing` and
:samp:`ieee.VITAL_Memory` packages are copyrighted by IEEE.  See source
file and the IEEE 1076.4 standards for more information.

The packages :samp:`std_logic_arith`, 
:samp:`std_logic_signed`, :samp:`std_logic_unsigned` and
:samp:`std_logic_textio` contained in the :samp:`synopsys` directory are
copyrighted by Synopsys, Inc.  The source files may be used and
distributed without restriction provided that the copyright statements
are not removed from the files and that any derivative work contains the
copyright notice.  See the source files for more information.

The package :samp:`std_logic_arith` contained in the :samp:`mentor`
directory is copyrighted by Mentor Graphics.  The source files may be
distributed in whole without restriction provided that the copyright
statement is not removed from the file and that any derivative work
contains this copyright notice.  See the source files for more information.

As a consequence of the runtime copyright, you may not be allowed to
distribute an executable produced by `GHDL` without the VHDL
sources.  To my mind, this is not a real restriction, since there is no
points in distributing VHDL executable.  Please, send a comment
(:ref:`Reporting_bugs`) if you don't like this policy.
