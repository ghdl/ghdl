   --  The purpose of SEM_NAME package is to handle association between
   --  identifiers and declarations.
   --  Roughly speacking, it implements ch10 of LRM: scope and visibility.
   --
   --  Basic elements are: declarations and declarative region.
   --  Declaration should be understood in the large meaning: any textual
   --   construction declaring an identifier, which can be a label.
   --  A declarative region contains declarations and possibly other
   --   declarative regions.
   --
   --  Rules are scope, visibility and overloading.
   --

   -- By closing a declarative region, all declarations made in this region
   --  are discarded.

   --  The interpretation must have been done in the current scope.

   --  a component_instantiation_statement.
