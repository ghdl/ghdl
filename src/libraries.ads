package Libraries is
   -- This package defines the library manager.
   -- The purpose of the library manager is to associate library logical names
   -- with host-dependent library.
   --
   -- In this implementation a host-dependent library is a file, whose name
   -- is logical name of the library with the extension '.cf'.  This file
   -- contains the name and the position (filename, line, column and offset)
   -- of all library unit of the library.
   --
   -- The working library WORK can be aliased with a ressource library,
   -- they share the same host-dependenet library whose name is the name
   -- of the ressource library.  This is done by load_work_library.
