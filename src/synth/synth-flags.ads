      --  This allows partial synthesis: black-boxes can be synthesized later.
      Name_Hash,

      --  Just append a unique index.  Create shorter names than Name_Hash,
      --  but the names depend on the whole design.  So it won't be possible
      --  to do partial synthesis (ie synthesizing a sub-module, and then its
      --  parent considering the sub-module as a black-box).
