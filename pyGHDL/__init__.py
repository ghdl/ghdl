"""
.. _python_interface:

GHDL offers two Python interfaces and a language server protocol service. All
this is provided from a ``pyGHDL`` packages with four sub-packages:

* :mod:`pyGHDL.cli` - Command line interface (CLI) applications.
* :mod:`pyGHDL.dom` - A high-level API offering a document object model (DOM).
  The underlying abstract VHDL language model is provided by :doc:`pyVHDLModel <vhdlmodel:index>`.
  The DOM is using ``libghdl`` for file analysis and parsing.
* :mod:`pyGHDL.libghdl` - A low-level API directly interacting with the shared library ``libghdl....so``/``libghdl....dll``.
  This is a procedural and C-like interface. It comes with some Python generators for easier iterating linked lists.
* :mod:`pyGHDL.lsp` - A :wikipedia:`language server protocol <Language_Server_Protocol>` (LSP)
  written in Python. The implementation offers an HTTPS service that can be used e.g. by editors and IDEs supporting LSP.
