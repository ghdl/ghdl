Quick Start Guide
#################

Since this is the user and reference manual for `GHDL`, it does not contain an introduction to `VHDL`. Thus, the reader
should have at least a basic knowledge of `VHDL`. A good knowledge of `VHDL` language reference manual (usually called LRM)
is a plus. Nevertheless, multiple explained examples are provided, in the hope that they are useful for users to learn
about both `GHDL` and `VHDL`.
